# AI and Cybersecurity Literacy in Ontario’s K–12 Education System

## Overview
This repository contains the research report examining the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) literacy and cybersecurity understanding among K–12 students in Ontario. As AI-enabled tools and digital platforms become increasingly embedded in everyday learning, students’ ability to navigate these technologies safely, ethically, and critically has become an essential component of modern digital literacy.

## Purpose of the Study
The report investigates students’ conceptual understanding of AI, their awareness of cybersecurity risks, and their broader digital literacy competencies. Despite strong general digital skills, findings reveal significant gaps in students’ ability to interpret AI systems, identify online threats, and apply safe digital practices. The study highlights the need for structured learning experiences that build ethical reasoning, critical evaluation skills, and responsible technology use.

## Key Findings
- Students regularly interact with AI-enabled tools but show uneven comprehension of how these systems function.
- Many learners struggle to recognize cybersecurity risks and apply safe online behaviors.
- Existing curriculum expectations support digital literacy but lack depth in AI and cybersecurity concepts.
- There is a growing need for targeted instructional strategies and assessment tools to support student learning.

## Implications
The insights from this research carry important implications for curriculum design, teacher professional development, and provincial education policy. Strengthening AI and cybersecurity literacy will require coordinated efforts across classrooms, school boards, and the Ministry of Education.

## Recommendations
The report concludes with actionable recommendations for:
- Educators seeking to integrate AI and cybersecurity concepts into instruction.
- School boards developing digital literacy strategies.
- Policymakers shaping future curriculum and assessment frameworks.
